# 🚀 Social Media ETL & Analysis: How Raw API Data Becomes Business Insights

## 📖 Project Story
While exploring how companies analyze social media platforms, one question stayed in my mind:

**“How do organizations convert massive amounts of raw social media data into meaningful insights?”**

Social media platforms generate huge volumes of unstructured data every second.  
However, raw API data cannot be directly used for analysis or decision-making.

This curiosity led me to build an **end-to-end ETL pipeline** that:
- Extracts raw social media data from an API
- Transforms and cleans the data
- Loads it into an analytics-ready format
- Performs **SQL-based post-ETL analysis**

This project simulates a real-world **data engineering + analytics workflow**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Requests** – API data extraction
- **Pandas** – Data transformation
- **CSV** – Data storage
- **SQL** – Post-ETL analysis

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Raw social media data is:
- Unstructured
- Difficult to analyze directly
- Not suitable for business reporting

This project aims to:
- Convert raw API data into structured datasets
- Enable analytical querying using SQL
- Demonstrate how ETL pipelines support data-driven decisions

---

## 📊 KPIs / Metrics Analyzed
- Total records processed
- User-level activity patterns
- Engagement-related attributes
- Aggregated insights using SQL queries

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 🔄 ETL Pipeline
- Extracted social media data from a public API
- Cleaned and transformed raw JSON data into tabular format
- Loaded the processed data into a CSV file for analysis

### 🧮 SQL Analysis (Post-ETL)
- Performed aggregations on processed data
- Filtered records based on business conditions
- Analyzed trends and patterns using SQL queries

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Raw API data must be transformed before meaningful analysis
- Structured datasets improve query performance and readability
- SQL enables fast aggregation and insight generation on ETL outputs
- ETL pipelines bridge the gap between raw data and analytics

---

## 🚀 Business Conclusion
Meaningful insights do not come directly from raw data.

They are enabled by:
- Well-designed **ETL pipelines**
- Proper data cleaning and structuring
- SQL-based analytical querying

This project demonstrates how **data engineering and analytics work together** to transform raw social media data into actionable insights.
